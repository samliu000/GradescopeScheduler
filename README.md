## Inspiration
As a student, keeping track of deadlines is important, especially with everything being virtual. Unfortunately, Gradescope, a website that allows professors to grade with ease, does not remind you about upcoming assignments. But, Google Calendar does. By creating this application, we are able to keep track of our Gradescope assignments using google calendar, effectively saving our grades. 

## What it does
The application creates a new Google Calendar for the user called Gradescope Calendar. The Gradescope Calendar adds the assignment dates to the calendar and titles them as the assignment name. This allows the user to view their assignments on a monthly, weekly, and daily calendar, and gives them the opportunity to plan and utilize their time effectively. Google calendar also sends notifications before the event occurs, giving the students time to complete their assignment before the due date. 

## How we built it
We built it by scraping data such as course ids, assignment names, due dates, and times from the Gradescope website. We parsed through all of the data to return an object that contained the strings with the assignment name as well as the due date/time. Separately, we connected our application to Google Calendars with the Google Calendars API. We created a function that would process through each single assignment and create an event with the assignment name and due date as its attributes. After creating the event, we insert it into the calendar we just created and print a success message. The application should create new events for every assignment until every assignment has been completed.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we ran into was our team’s unfamiliarity with Python. To overcome this, we utilized the internet and various websites to help us with syntax and Python methods. Another challenge we had to overcome was that half of our team did not have laptops that would work with Python and Google Calendar API. To solve our problem, we used zoom’s screen share function so everyone was able to still work together. 

## Accomplishments we’re proud of
One of the accomplishments that we are proud of is our ability to parse through the extensive data in order to retrieve the information that we needed. For example, we parsed through the HTML of the Gradescope website to find all of the assignment information for a given course. From there, we parsed the data such that it would be able to be passed into our functions. 

## What we learned
Many of us were unfamiliar with Python at the beginning of this project, so we learned Python syntax as well as methods such as datetime and requests. We also learned how to utilize the Google Calendar API within our application, which is something many of us have not done before. Using the Google Calendar API, we learned how to create a new calendar and new events for existing calendars using the Calendar methods. We also better learned how to use the Beautiful Soup Library to scrape the web. 

## What’s next for Gradescope Scheduler
As of right now, Gradescope Scheduler is a bit difficult to set up. It requires that each user must obtain their own Google credentials in order to connect the application to their Google Calendar. We hope to be able to make the application more user friendly so that everyone would be able to use the application.
